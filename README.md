<h2>About this Profile
<h3>Purpose<h3>
The purpose of this web profile was to create and design a website in a given time frame that also serves as a portfolio for the future that we can reiterate on as we learn new languages and develop new techniques.

<h3>Design<h3>

The Design I was going for that conveys my style,personality and what I enjoy looking at and making was a minimalist design. Short, brief and straight to the point, conveying my message as best as possible. "A picture is worth a thousand words"

<h3>Functionality and Features<h3>

The functionality of this website is to communicate with the global world, to establish my presence online for friends and future employers and client.

Going with the design, I made sure to keep the features inline with my design so nothing flashy that would take away from the art piece. For example, hovering over the clickable links results in the icon gradually increasing to size and decreasing when not hovering back on it.

<h2>Design Process<h2>
<h3>WireFraming<h3>
<h3>Personal Logo<h3>
<h3>Usability Considerations<h3>

For usability considerations, I made sure to give my non text links the ability to say what they are and where they lead to for everyone, particularly to those who are vision impaired.
